Prompt:
The following Python code is producing an error or warning:

Error message:
NameError: A variable or function name is not defined.

Code that needs fixing:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s', level=logging.INFO, datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
logging.info('Starting program')

df = pd.read_csv('xdata.csv')
df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype('float64')  # Convert age to float for regression
df['Tenure'] = df['Tenure'].astype('int64')  # Convert tenure to integer

# One-hot encode categorical variables
df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)  # Drop first dummy variable for encoded columns

# Split data into training and testing sets
X = df.drop('Exited', axis=1)
y = df['Exited']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
logging.info('Evaluating model')
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = round(model.score(X_test, y_test), 2)
logging.info(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Plot confusion matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
logging.info('Plotting confusion matrix')
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, cmap='Blues')
plt.show()

logging.info('Program completed successfully')
```

The original task is:
Based on the recommended machine learning model (LogisticRegression), write a Python program to load 'xdata.csv', perform preprocessing (including encoding categorical variables:  using pd.get_dummies with appropriate parameters to avoid deprecation warnings), split the data into training and testing sets, and apply the model. Add logging statements at the beginning and end of functions, before and after important operations, and during exception handling. Use the Python 'logging' module configured to log in JSON format. Do not include any comments in the code. Actual data in file 'xdata.csv' is not limited to sample data; the actual data file is large. Use the following data sample (10 rows) for reference:

RowNumber,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited
1,15634602,Hargrave,619,France,Female,42,2,0.0,1,1,1,101348.88,1
2,15647311,Hill,608,Spain,Female,41,1,83807.86,1,0,1,112542.58,0
3,15619304,Onio,502,France,Female,42,8,159660.8,3,1,0,113931.57,1
4,15701354,Boni,699,France,Female,39,1,0.0,2,0,0,93826.63,0

Ensure that the fixed code aligns with the original task and addresses the error. Only provide the corrected code without any explanations or comments.
