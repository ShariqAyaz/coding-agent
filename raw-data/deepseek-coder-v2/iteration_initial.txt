Prompt:
Based on the recommended machine learning model (LogisticRegression), write a Python program to load 'xdata.csv', perform preprocessing (including encoding categorical variables: Surname, Geography, Gender using pd.get_dummies with appropriate parameters to avoid deprecation warnings), split the data into training and testing sets, and apply the model. Include code for evaluating and plotting the results. Add logging statements at the beginning and end of functions, before and after important operations, and during exception handling. Use the Python 'logging' module configured to log in JSON format. Do not include any comments in the code. Actual data in file 'xdata.csv' is not limited to sample data; the actual data file is large. Use the following data sample (10 rows) for reference:

RowNumber,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited
